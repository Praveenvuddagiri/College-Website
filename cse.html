    <p>
        The Department of Computer Engineering was started in the year 1997 with the Post 
        Diploma in Computer Applications Programme and subsequently 
        Diploma in Computer Engineering was started in 1998. Seeing the 
        demand and scope of Computer Application, Diploma in Information
         Technology has also been added in the year 2003.

        The department with the passage of its evolution and 
        growth has succeeded in creating its place by producing quality
         products that are at par with their mainland counterparts. 
         The Computer Science Engineering Department offers courses 
         leading to Diploma in Computer Engineering, Diploma in Information 
         Technology. The department has taken a leap with the commencement 
         of B.Tech Programme in Computer Science & Engineering from the year 
         2009. 
        All the programmes have been approved by AICTE.
    </p>
    <p>
        The department has been covered under ISO Certification since
